# SudoStake Liquidity Vaults

A vault is a smart contract account that gives the account owner more flexibility around their staked tokens.

As more stakers manage their assets using vaults, it creates for a more distributed stakeholder base, which increases the overall network security.


&nbsp;

## What you get as a vault owner

1. Manage your staked tokens, from your vault, by carrying out standard staking operations like
`Delegate`, `Redelegate`, `Undelegate` and `ClaimDelegatorRewards`.

2. Transfer vault ownership to a new user. This is especially useful when moving staked assets between entities.

3. Withdraw the vault balance to your EOA or another address of your choice.

4. Request for $USDC liquidity using the staked tokens held in the vault as collateral.

5. Vote on active proposals using the staked assets in the vault.
